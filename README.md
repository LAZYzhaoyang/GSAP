## About
The Generic Software Architecture for Prognostics (GSAP) is a framework for
applying prognostics. It makes applying prognostics easier by implementing many
of the common elements across prognostic applications. The standard interface
enables reuse of prognostic algorithms and models across using the GSAP
framework.

There are two operational modes for GSAP: 'async' and 'simple'. These are both described below:
* 'async': Asynchronous GSAP. This takes advantage of parallization, including automatic thread management to perform calculations on multiple threads. 
* 'simple': Simple single-threaded GSAP. Resulting prognostics application is smaller and simplier, but does not take advantage of multi-threading. Ideal for resource constrained hardware.

The GSAP framework is used through the creation of communicators, prognosers, or
models (the deployment layer). The elements of the deployment layer plugs into
the framework and use the tools of the support layer. These elements are
described further below:

* **Communicators**:

Communicators are used to communicate data with the outside world. These
function as interfaces with various data sources and sinks. Some examples could
be a playback agent that reads from a file, a GUI for displaying prognostic
results, an automated report generator, or a client that connects into a network
messaging system (for example: SCADA). These systems can receive data which will
be used by prognosers or communicate the results with operators.

* **Prognosers**:

  This is the core of the GSAP system. Inside the prognosers is the core logic for performing prognostics. A new prognoser is created to support a new method for performing prognostics. Many prognostics systems follow a common model-based structure. Those systems do not require the creation of a new prognoser, only the creation of a new model that will be used by the modelBasedPrognoser. For more information on this see the section Extending.

* **Models**:

  Models are a method of representing the behavior of a component. A common way of performing prognostics is using a model that describes both the healthy and damaged behavior of the components. The modelBasedPrognoser uses the models to perform prognostics.

Each of these components is configured through the use of configuration files.
This allows for a GSAP deployment to be configured to a new configuration or
system without any software changes.

## Using
[See the Getting Started page for
information](https://github.com/nasa/GSAP/wiki/Getting-Started)

## Extending
GSAP is designed to be easy to extend to fit your use. Extending GSAP is done by
adding Prognosers, Models, Algorithms, or Communicators. When the behavior of the component
being prognosed is represented by a model, users can create a new model and use
the supplied modelBasedPrognoser for prognostics. This is done instead of adding
a new prognoser. [For more information on extending see the wiki
here](https://github.com/nasa/GSAP/wiki)
